    "maxAttempts": 3,
    "interval": 300,
    "backoff": "exponential"
  }
}
```

**Retry Strategies**:

    "duration": 1800,
    "action": "abort"
  }
}
```

**Timeout Actions**:
- **abort**: Abort task
- **continue**: Continue execution
- **savePartial**: Save collected data

## Concurrency Control

### Prevent Duplicate Execution

Ensure same task doesn't execute multiple times simultaneously.

```json
{
  "concurrency": {
    "preventOverlap": true,
    "skipIfRunning": true
  }
}
```

**Handling Strategies**:
- **Skip**: Skip current execution if task is running
- **Queue**: Wait for current execution to complete before executing
- **Abort**: Abort current execution and start new one

### Task Priority

Set execution priority for multiple scheduled tasks.

```json
{
  "priority": "high",
  "maxConcurrent": 3
}
```

**Priority Levels**:
- **high**: High priority, execute first
- **normal**: Normal priority
- **low**: Low priority, execute last

## Resource Management

### Execution Time Window Restrictions

Restrict tasks to execute only during specific time periods.

```json
{
  "executionWindow": {
    "allowedHours": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 22, 23],
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  }
}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Avoid website peak hours
- Utilize nighttime periods for collection
- Comply with website access restrictions

### Resource Limits

Limit system resources used by tasks.

```json
{
  "resources": {
    "maxMemory": "2GB",
    "maxCPU": "50%",
    "maxDuration": "30m"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Task Chains

Execute multiple tasks in sequence.

```json
{
  "taskChain": {
    "enabled": true,
    "tasks": [
      {
        "taskId": "task-1",
        "waitForCompletion": true
      },
      {
        "taskId": "task-2",
        "waitForCompletion": true
      },
      {
        "taskId": "task-3",
        "waitForCompletion": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Execution Flow**:
```
Task1 → Wait for completion → Task2 → Wait for completion → Task3 → Don't wait
```

### Conditional Execution

Decide whether to execute task based on conditions.

```json
{
  "conditionalExecution": {
    "enabled": true,
    "conditions": [
      {
        "type": "dataChange",
        "source": "task-1",
        "threshold": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "timeRange",
        "start": "09:00",
        "end": "18:00"
      }
    ],
    "operator": "AND"
  }
}
```

### Incremental Collection

Only collect new or changed data.

```json
{
  "incremental": {
    "enabled": true,
    "compareField": "id",
    "lastRunData": "stored"
  }
}
```

**Working Principle**:
1. Record data from last collection
2. Compare during current collection
3. Only save new or changed data
