# Privacy Policy for Octopus Crawler (Microsoft Edge Extension)

Octopus Crawler is a browser extension designed to help users collect and extract structured data from web pages.

## Data Collection

Octopus Crawler does not collect personal information by default.

The extension only processes data from web pages that the user explicitly chooses to extract. All extracted data and task configurations are stored locally in the user's browser.

## Data Storage

- All data is stored locally using the browser's storage mechanisms.
- No data is automatically transmitted to third-party servers.
- The extension does not use advertising, analytics, or tracking services.

## User Control

Users have full control over:
- When data collection tasks are created or executed
- Which web pages are accessed
- What data is extracted and stored

The extension only operates when explicitly triggered by the user.

## Permissions

The extension requests only the permissions necessary to provide its core functionality, such as accessing the current tab, executing user-defined tasks, and storing data locally.

## Account and Sync (Optional)

If the user chooses to sign in, the feature is used only to synchronize task configurations. Users may choose not to use this feature, and all core functionality remains available without signing in.

## Security

All code executed by the extension is included within the extension package. The extension does not load or execute remote code.
